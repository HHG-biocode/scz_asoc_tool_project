    <h1> Background</h1>
      <p> The Allele-Specific Open Chromatin Tool (ASoC-Tool) is an online tool to enable researchers to probe if a given SNP or set of genomic coordinates
        <br> are located in parts of the genome differentially accessible in schizophrenia (measured by ATAC-seq). Twenty individuals, heterozygous for ~70 SCZ-GWAS 
        <br> risk alleles, donated cells to the (RUCDR)-NIMH Stem Cell Center, which were then de-differentiated into iPSCs and re-differentiated into several cell types 
        <br> found in the brain by Professor Jubao Duan and his team at the Center for Psychiatric Genetics at NorthShore University HealthSystem. 
        <br> Using ATAC-seq, peak sets were generated in iPSCs, Glutamatergic Neurons (GNs), GABAergic Neurons (GAs), Microglia (MG), Dopaminergic Neurons (DNs)
        <br> and Neural Progenitor Cells (NPCs) (Zhang et al 2020). Below, you can search to see if a given SNP is located within a schizophrenia-associated 
        <br> allele-specific open chromatin peak within several different cell types. In addition, there is a genome browser tool (based off Dr. Zhong's
        <br> GIVE system) attached where you can use a Docker-containerized GRCh38 genome-based browser to examine the bigger picture (Cao et al 2018).
